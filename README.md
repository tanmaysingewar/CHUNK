Hey, I haven't added the code for answer generation using open source LLM as it is a simple API Call. You just have to store the answers generated with proper labels in a CSV.

I have uploaded a CSGA.ipynb file. Don't concentrate on the variables or file names. Response is the answer generated from open source LLM and reference is the GPT4 answer.

You can access the results here. They will show you what is being done : https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xkO6bqp0-sZsVmzShAlzkdh2ZpcqAkprhLuOA8CmhhE/edit?usp=sharing
